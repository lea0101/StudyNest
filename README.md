# StudyNest
A super cool web app for studying with friends


# Setup
You should typically be able to run `npm start` to run the application.

Otherwise, navigate to the `client/` folder, and try the following:
1. You may need to re-install npm packages, before doing so you should delete the file `package-lock.json` and the `node_modules/` folder: `rm -rf node_modules/ package-lock.json; npm i`
2. You may also need to ensure that the react-rouder-dom and react-icons packages are installed: `npm i react-router-dom react-icons`
